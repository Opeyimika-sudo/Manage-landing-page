# Frontend Mentor - Manage landing page solution

![Design preview for the Manage landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out the landing page and get it lookin as close to the design as possible.

A few things that made it tasking was the differing order of elements on mobile and desktop, unique width for different sections and the desire to build it while learning SASS (Synctactically Awesome Style Sheets) and BEM(Block-Element-Modifier);

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS
- BEM
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first SASS and BEM project so it was an interesting learning curve. I also learnt how to use background-position to tweak the position of background images, how to change images with a click, how to customize a scrollbar and the use of order in flex to re-arrange elements.
